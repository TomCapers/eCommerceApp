# eCommerceApp

## Description
This application allows a user to access and update an e-commerce database through Express.js API calls to a MySQL database. The application uses Sequelize to sync models to the MySQL database. The database schema, models and seed files are included in the repo. In the walkthrough video below I use Insomnia Core to invoke GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to the Products, Categories, and Tags tables.

## Installation
The app uses the following npm packages:
1.) dotenv for sensitive environment variables
2.) express for API calls
3.) MySQL2 and Sequelize to connect to the database

The walkthrough took more than the 5 minutes allowed on Screencastify, so it is presented here in 2 parts.
